# MachineLearning

# Stock Prediction : 
The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train  on a stock price dataset from Google Finance to predict a future price and to display the results using matplotlib.

# Gender Classifier:
The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.Also it compares different classifiers from scikit-learn and compared their results.
